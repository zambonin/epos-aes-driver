Revision 4905 from [1]. Placeholder repository for version control,
and frankly, so I don't have to deal with Subversion.

Quick start:
 * download GCC 4.4.4 from [2] and place it under `/usr/local/arm`
 * install the following 32-bit libraries: zlib, bzip2, ncurses, gcc-libs
 * things that run on EPOSMote III are inside the `app` folder
 * compile with `make APPLICATION=$APP` (don't forget the traits header)
 * `run` and `flash` are useful rules (the former needs `qemu-system-x86`)
 * check output from the board with `sudo cat /dev/ttyACM0`
 * `make -j veryclean` if anything goes wrong
