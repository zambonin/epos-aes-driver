Revision 4905 from [1]. Placeholder repository for version control,
and frankly, so I don't have to deal with Subversion.

Quick start:
 * download GCC 4.4.4 from [2] and place it under `/usr/local/arm`;
 * install the following 32-bit libraries: zlib, bzip2, ncurses, gcc-libs
 * check output from EPOSMote III with `sudo cat /dev/ttyACM0`
